    Cristiano Ronaldo – The Early Years reminds that Ronaldo was born in 1985 in a very poor family as the youngest of four children. His father named him Ronaldo after his favorite actor, Ronald Reagan. From early age Ronaldo began showing interests in football and his parents realized that playing sports may be his only chance to make it. After all he was a problem child, and sports made him focus and achieve something in his life.
    
    The neighborhood where Ronaldo lived was a working class one. His family lived in a tiny shack with tin roof that overlooked the ocean. His mother had to work multiple jobs mainly as a cleaning person and a cook in order to support the family, while his father was a gardener that drank too much. He died in 2005 from kidney failure. Ronaldo was very close to him and his death struck him greatly. He had urged him to go to rehab many times, but his father never did.
    But, thanks to his father, Ronaldo became a football wunderkind by the age of 10. At the age of eight he played for an amateur team called Andorinha. There his father was the kit man, which helped him enter the team. At the age of ten he was signed by Nacional, a local club, where he was spotted by Sporting.

    He loved the game so much that all he ever did was play football. He would even miss his meals to play or he would escape through his bedroom window with a ball instead of do homework.

<h2>Team he played for</h2>

<br> Sporting CP: 2002-2003</header>
Cristiano Ronaldo started as a right-winger in Sporting CP, where his athleticism and strength soon earned him a spotlight among the top clubs in Europe. Though he could only score five goals for the Portuguese outfit in 31 appearances, his cameos were highly revered by the fans with the club winning three domestic titles that season –  Superliga (the Portuguese League), Taça de Portugal (the Portuguese Cup and Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira (the Portuguese Super Cup).

Romanian manager László Bölöni had really unlocked the potential of Portuguese international with the forward even managing six assists in his only season with the club.

<br><P>Manchester United: 2003-09</p>
<p></p> Cristiano Ronaldo got the exposure at Sporting CP, it was his first stint with Manchester United that made the forward a household name across the world. Under Sir Alex Ferguson, who had roped in Cristiano Ronaldo for a reported £12.24 million fee, the forward evolved into a goal-scoring machine. He became a regular in the Premier League and the Champion League, playing alongside the likes of Wayne Rooney, Ruud Van Nistelrooy, Ryan Giggs and more.

After progressing rapidly year after year, it was in the 2006-07 Premier League season that Cristiano Ronaldo finally broke free to score in double-figures for the first time in his footballing career. He scored 20 goals and managed 23 assists as Manchester United lifted the English Premier League. He would follow that up with an incredible 42 goals feat next season, with the Red Devils winning both the Premier League as well as the UEFA Champions League in 2007-2008.
<h3> Madrid: 2009-18</h3>
Real Madrid had shelled out a then-world record of £80 million to bring Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United and the move was worth every penny. He scored a whopping 33 goals in his first season with Los Blancos to kickstart his footballing career’s best phase with the La Liga giants. In the 438 matches that Ronaldo played for Real Madrid, he managed 132 assists and scored an unbelievable 450 goals to become the club’s all-time highest goal-scorer.

Like Manchester United, Cristiano Ronaldo shared the Real Madrid dressing room with real stalwarts of the game in Toni Kroos, Iker Casillas, Sergio Ramos, Karim Benzema, Angel Di Maria, Luka Modric and more. With Real Madrid, Ronaldo went on to win an unparalleled four UEFA Champions League titles, two La Liga titles, three Club World Cups, three European Super Cups, two Copa del Rey and two Supercopa titles as well.

Real Madrid saw Ronaldo play under iconic managers like Manuel Pellegrini, Jose Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti, Rafael Benitez and Zinedine Zidane who managed to make the most optimum use of the superstar. Ronaldo ended up winning four more Ballon d’Ors and becoming the FIFA Men’s Player of the Year twice.

<br><p> juventus 2018-21</p>
<p></p> Ronaldo left Real Madrid a legend in 2018 to join Serie A giants Juventus, with the Italian club’s sole aim of winning the long evading UEFA Champions League. And although the five-time UCL winner failed to win the European title with the Italian club, he did deliver them two Serie A league titles, one Italian Cup and one Supercoppa Italiana (Italian Super Cup).

Since Sporting CP, Cristiano Ronaldo had his shortest club stint at any club with Juventus (three years), where he scored 101 goals in 134 appearances. Unlike Manchester United and Real Madrid, Juventus were on the downhill when Ronaldo joined them. With the management inexperienced as well, Ronaldo’s time at Juventus ended early with the player returning to his old club Manchester United in 2021.

<h5>international career</h5>

Portugal National Team: 2003-Present 
Ronaldo had to play in the U-15, U-17, U-20, U-21 and the Olympic team before he could make his senior debut for the Portugal national team on August 20, 2003, against Kazakhstan in an international friendly. And it was his solitary goal that had given Portugal the win. Cristiano Ronaldo became a mainstay during the Euro 2004 when Portugal managed to reach the final.

Though Cristiano Ronaldo has scored a mesmerizing 115 goals for the national team and is currently the top-scorer in the world with the most international goals, his only big success with Portugal came in Euro 2016, when Portugal had beaten France to win the European Championship.
